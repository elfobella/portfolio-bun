          My name is Yunus Emre UÇAR. I was born in Kocaeli, Turkey. I attended
          Levent Kırca Oya Başar Primary School for my primary and middle school
          education. My father passed away when I was 11 years old. Generally,
          my life has revolved around playing games. I played League of Legends
          and Fortnite, the latter of which I played professionally and
          qualified for the World Championship. I attended high school at İzmit
          TAML and university at Yozgat Bozok. I have been working as a
          Fullstack Web Developer for over four years now.
